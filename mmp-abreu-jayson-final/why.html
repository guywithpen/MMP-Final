 I would argure that there are a <b>multitude of factors that pile together.</b> Men are often pressured by society to prioritize income over their desired careers. Jobs are also scarce meaning men who are expected to support their families are left struggliing to provide. Men are often expected not show weakness and so they bottle their issues. There is also the issue of men dealing with sexual abuse. Recent or older trauma that eats away at those unfortunate few. The shame making it difficult to seek help.<P/>
