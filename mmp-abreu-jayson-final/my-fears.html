   Imagine this position as a parent. You’re raising a son and as he grows into manhood, he’s 3 times as likely to be a victim of suicide. You and him may talk but there’s 3 times the chance there’s something eating at him that he doesn’t have it in him to speak up. <b>3 times the chance to be put over the edge.</b>
